### Hi there! I'm Filippo (he/him) ðŸ‘‹
I've been in academia for many years until I reached tenure. Then I gave it all away to join [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai) and I'm happier than ever :)
Now I'm a senior quantum architecture scientist and the main developer of [Mr Mustard](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard), our photonic circuit optimizer.
